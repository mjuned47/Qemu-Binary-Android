How to build static qemu executable in Android ?

# Download Qemu Tarball from official site (http://qemu.org)
# Extract tar xvf qemu-***.tar.xz
# Create "build" directory inside qemu folder and go to build folder
# And execute with "--static" flag

../configure --static --enable-...
make -j4
make install

# for eg. --enable-spice --enable-opengl...  , to get help ../configure --help

Known Error :

# While building static qemu , errors may pop up because it will need static library( lib***.a and lib***.so)
# for linking even if you had install packages

How to get static library ?

# Assuming error : "cannot find -lmount"
# to fix this, you need static library (libmount.a and libmount.so)
# to get this library, you need to recompile source of respected required library
# libmount is part of util-linux, so download util-linux source and
# recompiled statically (../configure --enable-static ... ; make -j* ; make install )
